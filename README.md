# How to contribute - Guidelines

## Contribute in core FreeAPI codebase:

We welcome your interest in contributing to our open source project!

To contribute to FreeAPI, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them using conventional commit messages: `git commit -am "feat: Add new feature"`. For more details on the commit format and other guidelines, please refer to the [Contributor Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
4. Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin feat/your-feature-name`.
5. Submit a pull request to the main repository, explaining the changes you've made and providing any necessary details.

Here's a guide on how you can effectively contribute to our API hub:

1. Pull Requests for Readme Updates: Please refrain from sending pull requests solely for updating the project's readme file. While we appreciate the importance of clear and concise documentation, we prefer to focus on substantial code contributions and feature enhancements.

2. Grammar Updates: Our team values effective communication, but we're not grammar sticklers. You don't need to send pull requests solely for grammar fixes or minor language improvements. Instead, concentrate on the core functionalities and features of the project.

3. Avoid Updating Existing Public APIs: To maintain stability and consistency, we discourage direct updates to existing public APIs within the API hub. These APIs have been thoroughly tested and approved. However, if you encounter any bugs or issues, we encourage you to open an issue on our project's issue tracker to notify us.

4. Build New Project APIs: We encourage you to explore your creativity and contribute by building complete project APIs. These APIs should provide comprehensive solutions that can assist developers in constructing complex projects to showcase their skills and abilities. Your contributions in this area will greatly benefit the community.

5. Draft a Proposal and Discuss on Discord: Before diving into your project, we recommend drafting a proposal. This can include a mind map or outline of the API you intend to build and its potential benefits. Join our Discord community, where you can share your proposal, discuss ideas, and gather feedback from fellow contributors. Engaging in these discussions will enhance your backend portfolio and help shape the future direction of the project.

We appreciate your enthusiasm and look forward to your valuable contributions to our open source API hub project.

Together, we can foster a collaborative environment and make a significant impact in the API integration landscape.
